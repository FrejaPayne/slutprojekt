    <p>Campaigns (or movies) are grouped sets of environments used for gameplay in Left 4 Dead and Left 4 Dead 2. Campaigns are aesthetically presented as if they are individual zombie movies, complete with a poster on the loading screen for each one, and usually consist of several chapters (also referred to as "levels" or "maps"). Chapters are typically played in order, following a narrative in which the Survivors travel from a start point in the midst of the zombie apocalypse to an end point where a rescue vehicle to safety awaits, surviving the onslaught of the Infected as they go. The exact process of experiencing a campaign's content depends on the gameplay mode being played, with some modes utilising single chapters of a campaign for each game rather than progressing from one chapter to the next.
      Left 4 Dead initially released with four campaigns, while Left 4 Dead 2 initially released with five campaigns, with both games receiving additional downloadable campaigns after release. On Steam, downloadable campaigns are added to the games as free updates and are playable simply by purchasing and installing the games. On Xbox 360, downloadable campaigns must be purchased (excluding "The Last Stand" for the first game, which is available for free) and manually downloaded from the Xbox Live Marketplace.</p>
    <p>The majority of the official campaigns encompass a larger narrative when played in a particular order, but this is not enforced by the game. The Director-based gameplay of the Left 4 Dead games encourages players to enjoy any campaign multiple times.
    On the PC version of the game, custom community-made campaigns are also supported, which may vary in their structure compared to official campaigns (for example, some may simply serve as "map packs" for modes that only use a single chapter of a campaign per game, like Survival).</p>

<p>The train comes to a halt in Rayford, Georgia where the tracks end, where the Survivors' new plan is to find a boat and travel somewhere free of the infected. However, on the first boat, Louis finds a dozen Witches on board who nearly rip his leg off. They find another sailboat boat, but when they try to raise the obstructing bridge, one of the generators breaks down and the bridge stops halfway up. The Survivors now face an enormous horde plus 3 Tanks. Seeing that there's only one way this can end, Bill jumps down and fights his way to the generator that stopped and turns it back on, making sure that the bridge raises with the other 3 Survivors on it, but committing the ultimate sacrifice as the Infected eventually kill him. A little while later, the remaining three Survivors encounter four other Survivors who arrive in a racing stock car on the other side. They help them cross the bridge and see them on their way. When the other Survivors have left, Louis, Zoey, and Francis take the sailboat to inhabit islands far away from all of their troubles, and rest out until the apocalypse is over.</p>
<p>The military locks up the Survivors and a doctor explains to them that they are carriers. When Lieutenant Mora sounds the base's alarm to command retreat, the infected attack. Louis saves the lives of soldiers Jeff and Anne, who in return allow them to carry weapons to fight the infected with. Meanwhile, Bill, Zoey, and the doctor head towards the armory as well. They all meet up there and head across the base courtyard, towards an old train.</p>
